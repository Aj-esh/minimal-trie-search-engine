# Search-engine
Search engine using `trie` and `KMP` algorithms for unimodal text searches.

### Trie

A trie, also known as a prefix tree, a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of key-value pairs is used for storing the data for retrival. 

### Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm

KMP algorithm is an efficent method for comparing strings with sub-strings. It is particularly useful for finding all occurrences of a given pattern in a text. The KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern and constructs an auxiliary array called the Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array, which is used to skip characters while matching.
